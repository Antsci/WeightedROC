Fast, weighted ROC curves

Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis is one way to
evaluate an algorithm for binary classification. R package ROCR
implements ROC curve computation and many other evaluation
metrics. However, if the observations have weights then the ROCR
package can not be used, as of ROCR version 1.0-5, published on CRAN
2013-05-16.

The WeightedROC package implements ROC and Area Under the Curve (AUC)
computation for weighted binary classification problems. Also,
WeightedROC is 2-10x faster than ROCR for un-weighted problems (see
examples below).
